# dart-vim-flutter-layout
If you are trying to code in dart/flutter with vim but can't indent your code to save your life, this is my attempt of solving that problem, at least for my personal use.

You should probably still use [dart-lang/dart-vim-plugin](https://github.com/dart-lang/dart-vim-plugin), which is included in [vim-polyglot](https://github.com/sheerun/vim-polyglot).
